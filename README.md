# DEBorMTL
Numerical methods for toxicity modelling


This library (soon to be one!) examines the differences of DEB numerical methods (by using length as the dominant description of an animal) and the approach of the Metabolic Theory of Life, which uses mass as the main indicator of an animal's condition. The current work will evaluate the two approaches and try to answer the following questions:
Is it time for ecotoxicology to switch to numerical modelling instead of statistical modelling?
Are the DEB models adequate for this purpose or there are better modelling approaches we can apply for this purpose?


The library will be written in MATLAB and R statistical software by using the appropriate libraries (like deSolve, and other data handling and visualisation libraries).
All data will be saves as .csv or .xlsx files to ensure everyone can access and use the models.

In the end, a GUI will be created and everyone will be able to test the results even in this description!
